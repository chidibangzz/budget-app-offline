## Project title
Budget offline app
Have you ever been stuck without wifi on vacation? My budget app allows and individual to add up all their expenses and calculate their spending anywhere in the world and you dont even need WIFI.

## Motivation
Unfortunate situations happen where wifi is not available especially when on vacation. My goal was to make sure a person can keep up with there expenses online or offline.
